It’s no doubt, you must have played Tic Tac Toe (or knots and crosses in Ireland) in your school days and every one of us loves to play the game. You will be surprised to know that the game of Tic Tac Toe is known to exist since ancient Egypt times.

In this simple Python project , we are going to build an interactive game of Tic Tac Toe  where we’ll learn new things along the way

What is Tic Tac Toe?
Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.

The game is played by two individuals. First, we draw a board with a 3×3 square grid. The first player chooses ‘X’ and draws it on any of the square grid, then it’s the chance of the second player to draw ‘O’ on the available spaces. Like this, the players draw ‘X’ and ‘O’ alternatively on the empty spaces until a player succeeds in drawing 3 consecutive marks either in the horizontal, vertical or diagonal way. Then the player wins the game otherwise the game draws when all spots are filled.

Prerequisites:
Install pygame on your computer using;
	pip install pygame

Steps in building this Python Project

First, let’s check the steps to build Tic Tac Toe program in Python:
- Create the display window for our game.
- Draw the grid on the canvas where we will play Tic Tac Toe.
- Draw the status bar below the canvas to show which player’s turn is it and who wins the game.
- When someone wins the game or the game is a draw then we reset the game.

We need to run our game inside an infinite loop.
It will continuously look for events and when a user presses the mouse button on the grid we will first get the X and Y coordinates of the mouse.
Then we will check which square the user has clicked.
Then we will draw the appropriate ‘X’ or ‘O’ image on the canvas.
So that is basically what we will do in this Python project idea
